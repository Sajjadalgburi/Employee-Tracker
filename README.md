## Description

This week's assignment was an exciting journey where I crafted a robust command-line application from scratch to effectively manage a company's employee database. Leveraging the power of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL, I delved into the realms of content management systems (CMS), providing users with a seamless interface to interact with.

When users engage with the application, they are presented with a comprehensive list of options to choose from. These choices trigger calls to the database, facilitated by the mysql2 npm package. This connection allows the application to execute queries tailored to the user's selection, retrieving and displaying the relevant data within the terminal.

Implementing modern asynchronous programming techniques such as async/await, I ensured smooth and efficient execution of queries. This not only enhanced the responsiveness of the application but also streamlined the user experience.

Throughout the development process, I found immense satisfaction in overcoming challenges and adhering to strict guidelines. It demanded unwavering dedication and adherence to best practices. Despite the hurdles, I'm pleased to report that I successfully met all the Acceptance Criteria within the allotted timeframe.

Building this application was not just a task; it was a rewarding experience that honed my skills and deepened my understanding of software development.
